Car Price Prediction Model
Project Description:
Developed a robust machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various attributes, improving pricing accuracy and aiding in competitive market positioning.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection: Aggregated data from multiple sources, including online car listings, dealership records, and market reports.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identified and engineered critical features influencing car prices, such as mileage, brand, age, and condition.
Model Implementation: Tested various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) to determine the best fit.
Model Validation: Validated model performance using cross-validation techniques and refined it through iterative tuning.
Deployment: Deployed the final model to a user-friendly web application, enabling users to input car details and receive instant price estimates.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, Heroku, SQL

Impact:

Achieved a prediction accuracy of 92%, significantly improving the pricing strategy.
Reduced pricing errors by 18%, leading to better inventory turnover and customer satisfaction.
